# Project Summary

### Technologies Used:

This project was created using JavaScript and HTML. All code was written is Visual Studio Code (VSCode) version 1.47.3.

### Purpose of Project:

The purpose of this project was to create a table that is populated with recorded UFO sightings. The table is displayed on a functioning webpage that would allow an end user to enter different filter criteria. The UFO sightings table will respond by displaying the sightings data that match the filter criteria entered.

### Recommendation for Further Development:

1) Can we enlarge the dataset? If there were other UFO sighting datasets, we could add them to the current dataset, but only after confirming the new data does not have duplicates when compared to the current dataset. Adding additional sightings info would increase the amount of filterable data.

2) We have the city, state, and country of each sighting. A great visual addition to the webpage would be to add a world map that has a pin drop for each sighting location. The map could also be response to the filter criteria, that is entered, so the map would only display sightings that match the filter criteria.
